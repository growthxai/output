Add `agent()` and `skill()` abstractions to `@outputai/llm` for composing reusable LLM agents with structured output and a lazy-loaded skills system. Add `findContentDir()` to `@outputai/core` and fix skill path resolution to be relative to the prompt file rather than the calling module. Add `output-copy-assets` bin to `@outputai/core` to centralise worker asset copying.
